Assumptions Made:
The player is explicitly given in the map.txt file as an @.
Goblins can somehow jump on top of one another since they don't check for collision of each other. I may or may not fix this issue in the future.
Input requires you to press enter afterwards. You can type multiple directions in a single string for maximum efficency.
